	to be set to $CINTSYSDIR)
	cintversion should be: 6.1.19 (the earlier 6.1.12 did not work!)
	container implements now the margins and cleft, cwidth, etc dimension,
	in a coherent manner

[0.9.28]
	Check the presence of glib-config as well, separately from gts-config

[0.9.27]

	the current frame


[0.9.24]
	margins removed from frame, and implemented in container; many changes related to
	this!!!

	isolines2 drawstyle using gts library

[0.9.15]
	tic calculation improved: a tic at theoretical 0 (but represented by
	some value like 1.734e-18) will now be shown as 0
	upper limit for tics is extended by a tiny-bit to tolerate floating-point
	imprecisions

[0.9.14]
	operator%(function,function) introduced
	jpg terminal added

[0.9.13]

	floor() function added
	permanent attribute introduced for plottable

[0.9.11]

	the modification of sub frames/pads. Automatic replotting in case
	of mframe/mpad now works

[0.9.10]
	set::y1transform, set::y2transform, set::x1transform, set::x2transform
	introduced to easily set transformed axes

	Number of tics is limited to 50 to avoid problems arising from bad settings

	The global functions _1, _2, etc are initialized now more correctly

[0.9.9]
	replot_request class is returned by many set:: functions, upon which
	G__ateval will make a replot in interactive mode (for example set::grid(true)
	will cause an automatic replot)

	an title_autoset flag is implemented in axis. if user sets title, this is set to
	false, and the automatic title setting by dgraph will not have an effect

[0.9.8]
	_0 is replaced by LINENO if autotitles are used
	random() generator returned negative numbers. corrected.

[0.9.7]
	histogram interpolation implemented

	function-parameters PAR(x)

[0.9.2]
	bugs corrected in debian package creation: .deb file was always recreated
	debian package files are created in debian/package-files

	arc::draw functions implemented, but only 'rx' of the two different radii (rx and ry)
	has any effect, and it will be a circle anyway. 

	Documentation of mframe has the standard format

	changelog is copied to the documentation directory during install
	available via 'blop -h changelog' or 'blop -h version'

[0.9.1]
	Initial pre-release. Prepared to work with the future version of cint 
	(shipping a cint-config script)

	rpm and debian package creation is possible via 'make rpm' or 'make deb'
