<div class=prguide><u>Practical Guide:</u>
<p>
For help
<ul>
<li> type <tt>help("topic");</tt> at the <tt>blop&gt;</tt>
     prompt, when running the program interactively
<li> At your shell prompt type: blop -h topic
</ul>
(replace 'topic' by what you are looking for :-)

<p>
Blop's help system is HTML-based, and it is the same as what you can
find at its home-page <a
href="http://blopplot.sourceforge.net/">http://blopplot.sourceforge.net/</a>. 
You can look up a desired keyword in the documentation by typing
<tt>help("keyword");</tt> at your <tt>blop&gt;</tt> prompt (interactive session), or typing <tt>blop -h keyword</tt> at your shell prompt.  This will
do the following things:
<ul>
<li> If keyword ends in .h or .cc, this is treated as a source file,
and if the file exists, it is displayed. By this way you have quick
and direct access to source files, if you are a bit familiar with them.
<li> Look  up your keyword in a  help index file, which  is located at
INSTDIR/doc/help-index (INSTDIR is  by default /usr/local/blop, unless
you   changed   it   when   installing   blop).    (Additionally,   if
$HOME/.blop-help-index exists,  it looks up your keyword  also in this
file, so  you can  specify your own  lookup method for  your favourite
topics).  These files specify, which docfiles are the best for certain
keywords (the  format of these  files is line-based: words  before the
colon  are the  keywords,  words  after the  colon  are the  filenames
relative to INSTDIR/doc).
<ul>
  <li> If one file is dedicated for this keyword, that file is shown 
       in your browser
  <li> If several files are dedicated for this keyword, a list of choice
       is shown. 
  <li> If no files are dedicated, all docfiles are scanned for this keyword,
       and the results of this search are offered to you
</ul>
</ul>

<p> If you provide an initial '?' character, the search will be forced
(the   following    keyword   will   be   searched    in   the   whole
documentation). For example: help("?canvas");

<p> If  the help  index file  did not contain  your keyword,  and your
keyword was not found in any of the other docfiles, a messages stating
this will appear in your terminal (where you issued the command).

<p> In order  to browse this file you will  need a HTML-browser.  Blop
is  intelligent enough  to look  for  quite some  known HTML  browsers
installed  on  your   machine  (kfmclient (load into default kde
browser), firefox, mozilla, gnome-help-browser, lynx,  less, cat), in
this order.   When a 
helpfile is  to be  displayed, these commands  are tried  in sequence,
until one of them succeeds.  Blop tries to figure out if you are using
a graphical terminal from  the existence of the environmental variable
DISPLAY. If this variable is  not set, the graphical browsers will not
be  made available, only  'lynx' and  'less'. To specify your
preferred HTML-browser as the help viewer for blop, you have can do this:
<ul>

<li>  Set  the  environment variable  <tt>BLOP_HELPVIEWER</tt>  before
invoking       blop.       (In      bash       say      <br><tt>export
BLOP_HELPVIEWER="my_browser  %f";</tt><br> In tcsh  say <br><tt>setenv
BLOP_HELPVIEWER "my_browser %f";</tt>).<br>  The '%f' in this variable
will be replaced by the filename to be displayed.

</ul>

<p>
There are some specific 'topic's:
<dl>
<dt>documentation</dt>
<dd>The index of the documentation is displayed</dd>
<dt>tutorial</dt>
<dd>You are directed to the tutorial immediately</dd>
<dt>keywords</dt>
<dd>A list of available keywords (for which a dedicated topic exists) is printed to the standard output</dd>
</dl>

<p>  You  often find  yourself  not  running  blop interactively,  but
instead,  writing a script.  Thus, you  do not  have any  running blop
process, but you would like to look for help. It is painful to start a
blop process, type help("something");  and then terminate the process,
etc. Therefore  the command  line option -h  is reserved to  make your
life easier:  saying <br><tt>blop -h  topic</tt><br> will do  this job
for your.
