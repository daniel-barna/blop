<p> One way of using blop is to  write a C++ script and run blop as an
interpreter on  this file. This is  the recommended way  to make small
tasks, process  and plot  datafiles, etc. However,  you might  want to
make some heavy data analysis  with a compiled C++ program, and create
plots within this program. No  problem, you can use blop's classes and
functions in your compiled software easily: 

<ul> 
<li>#include "blop.h" in your source files 
<li>Remember that all of blop's classes and
functions are declared within the namespace 'blop', so either refer to
them  as  <tt>blop::plot(...)</tt>,  for  example, or  say  '<tt>using
namespace blop;</tt>'  in your code,  whereever you want to  use blop.
<li>Compile your program 
</ul>

<p> There is a script called <tt>blop-config</tt> which can be used to
obtain the flags  to be given to the C++  compiler (such as libraries,
location  of  include  files,  etc).   Using this  script  instead  of
hard-coding these  locations in your  Makefile can make  your software
independent  from  the  actual  installation  location  of  blop,  and
therefore it  will be easy  to port it  to other machines,  where blop
might be installed at some other directories.


<p> It accepts the following command line arguments:

<dl>

<dt>--cflags</dt>
<dd>Prints the flags to be given to the c++ compiler</dd>

<dt>--libs</dt>
<dd>Prints the flags specifying the blop libraries (to be given to the
linker). </dd>

<dt>--cint</dt> 
<dd>If  this argument is  also given,  then the  cflags and  libs will
include also those flags,  which are necessary for interpreter support
(that  is, you  can use  CINT's features,  and you  can  interpret C++
statements in  your program).  Your  program will be linked  with CINT
libraries. Refer to the CINT manual in this question.  </dd>


<dt>-n | --namespace</dt>

<dd>The flags printed for the compiler will include such a flag, which
will cause a statement<br>
<tt>using namespace blop;</tt><br>
in the <tt>blop.h</tt> header file, putting all functions/classes of
blop into the global namespace</dd>

</dl>

<p> If you want to make the --cint and -n options the default for
blop-config, create a file <tt>$HOME/.blop/blop-configrc</tt>, and
include these lines (they must follow bash syntax):<br>
<pre>CINT=true
NAMESPACE=true</pre><br>

<p>
If you encounter  problems, such as some classes  of blop are reported
as unknown by your compiler, the  reason is most probably that not all
the necessary files are included  in 'blop.h'. This is not your fault,
but mine. Please drop  me a mail, and if you have  no time to wait for
the  correction,  search  the   blop  header  files  (in  the  default
installation scheme  located in  /usr/local/blop/) to find,  which one
contains the classes you are missing, and add these files to blop.h
(by     default     located     at    /usr/local/blop/blop.h,     with
/usr/local/include/blop.h being a symlink to this file).
