<h2>What is BLOP?</h2>

<p> BLOP is a script-based plotting utility to create scientific plots
in complete  harmony with LaTeX  documents (see the following  text to
figure out what  it means). I have developed it  during writing my PhD
to  create its  figures.  Since  then  it has  been almost  completely
rewritten  in order  to provide  a  more flexible  way of  calculating
lengths and to provide full control to the user to accurately position
every object in the plot.

<h2>Why the name "BLOP"?</h2>

<p> The 3 letters L,O,P stand for Latex-Oriented Plotter. However, the
word 'lop' in hungarian means 'steal', so I looked for something which
sounds  better. With  the first  letter of  the alphabet  it  would be
'ALOP',  which also  sounds  funny.   With the  second  letter of  the
alphabet it is fine: BLOP!  (And this is accidentally also the initial
letter of my name. 

<h2>Why yet another plotting utility?</h2>

<p>In scientific communities LaTeX  is very often used for typesetting
documents. In fact,  most journals in physics require  the articles to
be written using LaTeX. The most  common way of including figures in a
LaTeX document  is to  create an  .eps file, and  include it  with the
\includegraphics  command  (provided  by  the \graphics  or  \graphicx
packages).  In  order  to  match  the  layout  of  the  document,  the
\includegraphics command provides  possibilities to scale the included
graphics    (in    the     horizontal    and    vertical    directions
separately). However, when scaling an .eps graphics, everything inside
the graphics is scaled: fonts, width  of lines, etc. So if you produce
an .eps file, you have to know its final size at the time of producing
it; otherwise you may get too large or too small fonts when scaling it
in the document.  Moreover, if you apply different  scaling factors in
the horizontal and vertical directions, the graphics will be distorted
(which is especially painful for the texts inside the graphics).

<p>The best quality mathematical typesetter (which I know of) is still
TeX,  so  it is  desired  that  text inside  a  figure  is typeset  by
TeX/LaTeX.  This would  make it  possible to  include  any complicated
mathematical formula  into the figure,  without having to learn  a new
syntax.  Moreover, this  would make  it possible  that texts  inside a
graphics  would  match  the   surrounding  document  in  fontsize  and
fontstyle.  Changing  the   document's  fontsize  or  fontstyle  would
automatically be reflected in the graphics as well.

<p>I                   have                   used                  <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/">gnuplot</a>         for
creating my plots.  Gnuplot's <tt>pstricks</tt> terminal avoided these
problems: it produced a LaTeX macro file, which could be scaled in the
horizontal and vertical directions independently, without distortions,
and text was  typeset by LaTeX.  However, since the  size of the texts
inside the  graphics could not be  known at the time  of producing the
figure (since it WILL be typeset by LaTeX, when the figure is included
in a document),  perfect alignment of the objects in  a figure was not
possible. BLOP's main goal is to avoid all these problems, and provide
the  possibility to perfectly  align every  object inside  a graphics,
knowing  the exact  size (in  its final  look !!!)  of each  object in
advance.

<h2>User interface: CINT</h2>

<p>BLOP   is   written   in    C++.   Its   user   interface   is   <a
href="http://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html">CINT</a>       (a      C/C++
interpreter). So the syntax of the user's scripts is C++, in which all
the classes and functions provided by the BLOP package are usable. Why
have I chosen CINT?  

<ul> 
<li>  CINT is an excellent  software, I was
always   surprised  to   see  how   much  of   the  C++   standard  it
implements. Its author,  Masaharu Goto is a very  helpful person, with
prompt answers to my questions (don't feel this as an encouragement to
bomb him with stupid questions :-) 
<li> It  was easier  to use  an
available  interpreter,  than  designing  a new  interpreter  and  new
syntax.  
<li> The  services of  BLOP can  be used  in a  compiled C++
program  as well.  Since  the language  of  the user  scripts is  C++,
exactly the same set of commands  can be used in a compiled program as
well.  
<li>  Handy functions  are provided  to make  the scripts  as  easy as
possible. But  since the  interpreter knows about  all classes  of the
BLOP  package, the  user  has access  to  the deepest  details of  the
software  as   well.  This   solution  therefore  gives   the  highest
flexibility,  while   keeping  the  simplicity   for  non-advanced  or
non-ambitious users. 
<li>  Arbitrarily complex C-functions can be defined in the script,
and they can be plotted, or they can be used to transform the content
of the datafiles on-the-fly.
</ul>

<p>  A great feature of CINT is the TAB-completion: when running
interactively, if you write the first part of the name of an existing
variable, or a class, and you press TAB, the word will be completed,
if it can uniquely be determined from the given part. If not, pressing
TAB twice pops up a list of variables and classes beginning with the
given word. 

<p>  According to  the  opinion of  some  people, C++  is  not a  good
language  for scripting.  Although I  partly agree  with this,  I also
believe that  it can be really  fine if the provided  services (set of
classes,   functions)   are   well   designed.  The   simplicity   and
easy-to-write-ness of user scripts was  also a main goal in the design
of  BLOP (it  is the  task of  the users  [You!] to  decide how  it is
fulfilled).   For  example the  feature  of  many scripting  languages
(Perl, etc), that variables can  simultaneously be used as a string or
as a double,  is imitated in BLOP by the introduction  of a new class,
<tt>var</tt>, which provides functions and operators to access, set or
modify it as a string or double.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li> Through CINT  (see above) the user can  write arbitrarily complex
scripts with loops, functions, etc.

<li>  The content  of  datafiles is  not  only stored  and handled  as
floating   point   values,    but   simultaneously   as   strings   as
well. Datafiles can therefore contain  labels to be placed on the plot
at coordinates, which are also specified in the datafile.

<li> Perfect alignment (see above). 

<li> .... etc, etc, etc

</ul>
